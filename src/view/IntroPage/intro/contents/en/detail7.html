One night a bearded old man came up to him and said to him, "the crocodile, the crocodile, who ate the man for refining, now eats 99 people.And if one man can make a good one, he will not harm another. Don't stop it, let it leave early, and it will be all right. "How can you ask me to let the animal go to harm the animal?" she said angrily. Even if a person is a life, I will never let the crocodile succeed again. "The old man laughed and said," this is the case with the old man, who gave you two things, but your heart was in it. "And he took out a piece of gauze clothing from the bosom and a silver needle, said:" crocodile fatal point is the eye, you wear gauze clothing, near the crocodile with needles are its deadly right.At the same time, the old man repeatedly ordered that the assassination should be done before daybreak, and that she would hurry to go home and take off the clothes.
