                    Said Mr Beach, we have to start with the emperor, liu bei's reign period, there is a servant called pang tong, pang tong is a man of great history, he is a famous three kingdoms period, and the counsellor, liu2 bei4 reuse. He died in an early age when he was following liu in the state of yizhou, now in chengdu, sichuan province. His son, pang hong, had always been given the care of liu bei, and he inherited his father's good temperament, and he was very intelligent and talented from an early age. He was also heavily influenced by liu bei. When liu bei died, liu chan took off. Contrary to pang hong, he pushed the puns out of the remote fuling county to the postIt is. Pang hong, during his time in office, was conscientious and conscientious, and did a lot of good things for the people. There was an accident here, and was buried here, when the case came back. Later, the local people named it pontan in honor of him. This is a monument to the great achievements of his life. Because of the impounding of the wujiang plant, the monument has been submerged. Perhaps it was because of pang's story that he was so moved by the fact that god could not bear to be alone with him, and sent a monkey to accompany him here. Now you can see if there's a monkey on the top of pontan who is greeting everyone. This is our god monkey.
